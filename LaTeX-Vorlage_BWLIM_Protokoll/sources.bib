@article{semi-schedules,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a brief review on job shop scheduling techniques in semiconductor manufacturing. The manufacturing environment in a semiconductor industry is considered a highly complex job shop, involving multiple types of work centers, large and changing varieties of products, sequence-dependent setup times, reentrant process flow, etc., in a dynamic scheduling environment. Due to the stubborn nature of the deterministic job shop scheduling problem itself, many of the solutions proposed are of hybrid construction cutting across the traditional disciplines. The problem has been investigated from a variety of perspectives resulting in several analytical techniques combining generic as well as problem-specific strategies. In this paper, we seek to provide a brief overview of the problem, the techniques used and the researchers involved in solving this problem. },
